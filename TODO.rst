TODO:
----
- Figure out and develop output format where the outputs combine multiple catalogs to enable easy searches and light curve builds sorted by SNID.
- Add cosmological dimming to source spectra using LSST framework
- Add floor to sncosmo spectra so that empty Sed exception is not thrown.
- Do checks of magnitude calculations with SNCosmo values, turn into a unittest
- refactor code into something sensible
